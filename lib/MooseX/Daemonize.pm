=head1 NAME

MooseX::Daemonize - provides a Role that daemonizes your Moose based application.


=head1 VERSION

This document describes MooseX::Daemonize version 0.0.1


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package FileMaker;
    use Moose;
    with qw(MooseX::Daemonize);

    sub create_file {
        my ( $self, $file ) = @_;
        open( FILE, ">$file" ) || die;
        close(FILE);
    }

    no Moose;

    # then in the main package ... 
    
    my $daemon = FileMaker->new();
    $daemon->start();
    $daemon->create_file($file);
    $daemon->stop();
     
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Often you want to write a persistant daemon that has a pid file, and responds appropriately to Signals. 
This module helps provide the basic infrastructure to do that.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item progname Str

The name of our daemon, defaults to $0

=item pidbase Str

The base for our bid, defaults to /var/run/$progname

=item pidfile Str

The file we store our PID in, defaults to /var/run/$progname/ 

=item foreground Bool

If true, the process won't background. Useful for debugging. This option can be set via Getopt's -f.

=back

=head1 METHODS 

=over

=item check()

Check to see if an instance is already running.

=item start()

Setup a pidfile, fork, then setup the signal handlers.

=item stop()

Stop the process matching the pidfile, and unlinks the pidfile.

=item restart()

Litterally 

    $self->stop();
    $self->start();

=item daemonize()

Calls C<Proc::Daemon::Init> to daemonize this process. 

=item kill($pid)

Kills the process for $pid. This will try SIGINT, and SIGTERM before falling back to SIGKILL and finally giving up.

=item setup_signals()

Setup the signal handlers, by default it only sets up handlers for SIGINT and SIGHUP

=item handle_sigint()

Handle a INT signal, by default calls C<$self->stop()>;

=item handle_sighup()

Handle a HUP signal. Nothing is done by default.

=item get_pid

=item save_pid

=item remove_pid

=item meta()

the C<meta()> method from L<Class::MOP::Class>

=back

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=for author to fill in:
    A list of all the other modules that this module relies upon,
    including any restrictions on versions, and an indication whether
    the module is part of the standard Perl distribution, part of the
    module's distribution, or must be installed separately. ]

Obviously L<Moose>, also L<Carp>, L<Proc::Daemon>, L<File::Flock>, L<File::Slurp>

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

=for author to fill in:
    A list of any modules that this module cannot be used in conjunction
    with. This may be due to name conflicts in the interface, or
    competition for system or program resources, or due to internal
    limitations of Perl (for example, many modules that use source code
    filters are mutually incompatible).

None reported.


=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

=for author to fill in:
    A list of known problems with the module, together with some
    indication Whether they are likely to be fixed in an upcoming
    release. Also a list of restrictions on the features the module
    does provide: data types that cannot be handled, performance issues
    and the circumstances in which they may arise, practical
    limitations on the size of data sets, special cases that are not
    (yet) handled, etc.

No bugs have been reported.
