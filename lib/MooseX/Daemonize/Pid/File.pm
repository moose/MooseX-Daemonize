=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object extends L<MooseX::Daemonize::Pid> to add persistence in a Pidfile.

This class sets up some basic coercion routines for itself so that it can
be created from a I<Str> (a file name), I<ArrayRef> (an array of path components
for a filename) or a I<Path::Class::File> object.

This class registers it's type with L<MooseX::Getopt> as well, and is expected
to be passed on the command line as a string (which will then go through the
coercion routines mentioned above).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item I<pid Int>

This is inherited from L<MooseX:Daemonize::Pid> and extended here to
get it's default value from the Pidfile (if available).

=item I<file Path::Class::File | Str>

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item B<clear_pid>

=item B<has_pid>

Both of these methods are inherited from L<MooseX:Daemonize::Pid> see that
module for more information.

=item B<remove>

This removes the Pidfile.

=item B<write>

This writes the Pidfile.

=item B<does_file_exist>

This checks if the Pidfile exists.

=item B<is_running>

This checks if the Pidfile exists, if it does it checks to see if the process
is running, if the Pidfile doesn't exist, it returns false.

=item meta()

The C<meta()> method from L<Class::MOP::Class>

=back

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

Obviously L<Moose>
